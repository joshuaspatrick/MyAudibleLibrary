window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The wind is always looking for a story to tell....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>On a dark, wintry day, Eliza Grey receives a mysterious letter from her ailing Nana Mora begging her to come for a visit. This is an easy \"Yes\". Eliza has always preferred Nana Mora's beach cottage on St. Simons Island to the apartment she and her mom call home in the city. The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before itâ€™s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale. As Nana Mora says: \"Some stories aren't fiction, my darling Eliza. Some stories are lifetimes.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
