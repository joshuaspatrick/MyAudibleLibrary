window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three times they tried to kill her. Then they hired a professional. She hired Riyria. </p> <p>When the last member of the oldest noble family in Avryn is targeted for assassination, Riyria is hired to foil the plot. </p> <p>Three years have passed since the war-weary mercenary Hadrian and the cynical ex-assassin Royce joined forces to start life as thieves for hire. Things have gone well enough until they receive the odd assignment to prevent a murder. Now they must venture into a forgotten corner of southern Avryn - a place whose history predates the empire. As usual, challenges abound as they try to anticipate the moves of an unknown assassin before it's too late. </p> <p>But that's not their only problem. The countess of Dulgath has a dark secret she's determined to keep hidden. Then there's the little matter of Riyria's new employer...the Nyphron Church. </p> <p>From the best-selling author of <i>The Riyria Revelations</i> comes the third installment of The Riyria Chronicles. Although part of a series, it's designed to thrill both new listeners and Riyria veterans wishing to reunite with their favorite rogues. </p>";
