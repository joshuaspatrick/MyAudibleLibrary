window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>To-do list: remove the curse of Cthulhu. Kill a demigod. Eat a unicorn heart.</p> <p>My name is Cain Sthyldor, a former assassin for the fae. I've met Death in person, I'm cursed by Cthulhu, know a gorgon, and have a pet octopus named Fred.</p> <p>I may not be a wizard from Chicago, an iron druid on the run, a hot-tempered maker who hates Girl Scouts, or part of a destructive duo from New York City, but I guarantee you'll be entertained.</p> <p>The fae hate me because I started a war to free myself from their clutches. The humans hate me because I used to work for the fae. My only real friends are a bartending elf and a half-fae assassin who claims she'll kill me for the price on my head - one day. Until then, we'll be sipping mangoritas at Voltaire's.</p> <p>These days, I'm a tracker and bounty hunter for a supernatural agency called Eclipse. I may not assassinate anymore, but I find elusive targets, and what Eclipse does with them is none of my business. At least until now. My target is a teenaged girl, and I don't like the thought of ordinary kids being taken or killed. But when I refuse to do the deed, I'm suddenly being hunted by a demigod who can hurl lightning like nobody's business.</p> <p>The fae told us the gods are dead. Apparently, they're very much alive, and Zeus is still up to his dirty little shenanigans. His kid is now an assassin for a group called the Divine Council, and they want this girl dead.</p> <p>Stupidly, I take her under my protection, and now, I've got Eclipse, a demigod, and several other competing factions who all want the girl for their own nefarious purposes. And it doesn't take long for me to find out why.</p> <p>The factions are weaponizing demigods. Some want to use them against the fae. Some want to rule the world. And others want to kill the gods themselves.</p> <p>To top it off, the curse of Cthulhu is eating me to the bone, and the only way to cure it is to eat a living unicorn heart.</p> <p>Will I survive? Enter the Chronicles of Cain and find out.</p>";
