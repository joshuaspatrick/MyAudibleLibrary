window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In my world, magic is an everyday thing. </b></p> <p>It's on street corners; it's in our schools; our homes, and even our governments. Magic carpets share the sky with jets, international boxing shares air time with magical duelists. It's a whole mess, but nobody consulted me before outing every mage on the planet.</p> <p>My twin brother is a Wizard and thinks he's the only magician in the family. It's actually a little funny that he hasn't suspected anything different over the last 17 years - with my constantly need to keep his idiot face out of danger and stupidity - but that's not today's problem. You see, someone's trying to kill him.</p> <p>It started off with a shadow monster that was all but immune to my magic attacking him at school, and it went steadily downhill from there, meandering through an encounter with a succubus - a species I was told categorically didn't exist anymore - to nearly getting abducted by murderous homeless men and blasted by the government's anti-magic police. And that was just Monday!</p> <p>Now, I'm trying to help the idiot while also doing my level best to keep him from finding out about my own powers (which are frankly so sinister that I was terrified of my own shadow for the first decade of my life). I have to make sure, in my blundering about, trying to solve a mystery that I can't trust the Supernatural Crimes Authority to investigate correctly, that I don't draw the attention of the people with horrific monsters at their beck and call. Family can be such a pain....</p>";
