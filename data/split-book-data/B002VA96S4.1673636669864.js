window.bookSummaryJSON = "Michael Crichton's novel opens on the threshold of the twenty-first century. It is a world of exploding advances on the frontiers of technology. Information moves instantly between two points, without wires or networks. Computers are built from single molecules. Any moment of the past can be actualized - and a group of historians can enter, literally, life in fourteenth-century feudal France. Imagine the risks of such a journey. <p>Not since <i>Jurassic Park</i> has Michael Crichton given you such a magnificent adventure. Here, he combines a science of the future - the emerging field of quantum technology - with the complex realities of the medieval past. In a heart-stopping narrative, <i>Timeline</i> carries you into a realm of unexpected suspense and danger, overturning your most basic ideas of what is possible.</p>";
