When a deer heart appears on the coffin of a royal governess who did not confess to the dreadful sin it represents, the older Sin Eater refuses to eat it. She is taken to prison, tortured, and killed. To avenge her death, May must find out who placed the deer heart on the coffin and why.</p> <p>“Very much reminiscent of <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i>...it transcends its historical roots to give us a modern heroine” (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).&nbsp;</p> <p>“A novel as strange as it is captivating” (<i>BuzzFeed</i>), <i>The Sin Eater</i> “is a treat for fans of feminist speculative fiction” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) and “exactly what historical fiction lovers have unknowingly craved” (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>).&nbsp;</p>";
