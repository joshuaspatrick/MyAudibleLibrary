window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best seller and Audie nominee for Best Fantasy Novel Edward W. Robertson comes book 2 of the hotly anticipated spin-off from the Cycle of Galand universe. </b></p> <p>Cally and Rowe have scoured the demonic wights from Narashtovik.&nbsp;</p> <p>But during the war, Cally learned he can no longer be part of the pacifist Order that raised him to be a sorcerer. The pair has traveled south, seeking the true copy of The Cycle of Arawn - the artifact Cally believes can restore proper rule to Narashtovik.&nbsp;</p> <p>There's a few problems with this plan, though. For one, nobody's seen the true copy in decades. And another, in these lands, possessing a copy of the Cycle is rewarded with a quick trip to the hangman. If anyone finds out Cally can wield the dark arts of the nether, he'll wish all he got was hanged.</p> <p>Hunting for the book in the Western Kingdoms, Cally and Rowe are arrested by the Inquisition and sentenced to serve them. Since the Inquisition tracks down banned books, Cally has a better chance to find his prize than ever. But one slip will cost him his life. As the Inquisition pursues its leads, it exposes a conspiracy that could be more devastating than the one that almost destroyed Narashtovik.</p>";
