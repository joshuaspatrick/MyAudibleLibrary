Sterling just happens to be very good at it.</p> <p>Vainglorious vampire Sterling is forced to trade his big city hedonism for a trip to a sleepy mountain town, where mangled dead bodies have been discovered.

But they’re distractions from the hunt for the mountain murderer. And then there’s the eerie enigma: Why are all these corpses missing their faces?</p>";
