window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Renowned scholar William Lane Craig offers a listenable, rich training manual for defending the Christian faith. </p> <p>This concise guide is filled with sidebars and memorizable steps to help Christians stand their ground and defend their faith with reason and precision. In his engaging style, Dr. Craig offers four arguments for God's existence, defends the historicity of Jesus' personal claims and resurrection, addresses the problem of suffering, and shows why religious relativism doesn't work. Along the way, he shares his story of following God's call in his own life. </p> <p>This one-stop, how-to-defend-your-faith manual will equip Christians to advance faith conversations deliberately, applying straightforward, cool-headed arguments. They will discover not just what they believe, but why they believe - and how being on guard with the truth has the power to change lives forever. </p>";
