window.bookSummaryJSON = "The world will end on Saturday. Next Saturday. Just before dinner, according to <i>The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch</i>, the world's only completely accurate book of prophecies, written in 1655. The armies of Good and Evil are amassing and everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture. And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist. Put <i>New York Times</i> best-selling authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett together...and all Hell breaks loose.";
