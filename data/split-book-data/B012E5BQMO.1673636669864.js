But with his former teacher back in Britain, Alex is in desperate need of allies, and he'll do whatever it takes to get them - even if it means accepting a job with the Keepers, enforcing magical law. Alex forms an uneasy alliance with his new partner, Caldera, but his attempt at legitimacy quickly turns lethal when a mission puts him in possession of an item that factions both inside and outside of the Council would kill to get their hands on. </p> <p>Once again caught in the middle of a deadly conflict, Alex will need all his abilities to figure out who his friends are - especially when enemies are hiding on all sides.... </p>";
