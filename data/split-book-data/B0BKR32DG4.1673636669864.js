Within weeks—if not days—Rale will be destroyed. One last hope remains.</p> <p>They can't kill Nolost, but they may be able to eject him from Rale before he can complete his work. To do so, though, they'll have to destroy a world themselves: Olastar, the home of the portals that link all other places together.</p> <p>Even with a guide to help them through it, Olastar seems bent on killing them by assaulting them with grotesquely warped animals and malevolent spirits.</p> <p>As they work toward the world's core, they learn something horrifying: this strange realm isn't unpopulated like they'd assumed; it's inhabited by millions of people. If Dante and Blays want their own world to live, they'll have to kill every last one of them.</p>";
