window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ian Dex fights fiendish ubernaturals, battles smoking hot mages, and can seduce a succubus in an instant. He's also the chief of the Las Vegas Paranormal Police Department (PPD)...where it's always crazy, completely unpredictable, and loaded with snark.&nbsp;</p> <p>Note: These audiobooks contain adult themes &amp; language, tons of innuendo, and dirty jokes. You have been warned. ;)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Merging</i> (Book 1) - A new demon-powered mage has arrived on the Strip and he's quite a tool. Worse, he looks like a flippin' Chippendales model...and he knows it. Ian Dex and his crew have to cut their way through a megalomaniac vampire, a lunatic werewolf, a seriously annoying fae, and a buttload of demons in order to take down Captain Hot Pants. All in a day's pay...except that they work at night.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Grave Creatures</i> (Book 2) - When local cemeteries start spitting out their dead like quarters from a slot machine, Dex and his supernatural crew aren’t strong enough to handle the onslaught. As the zombies approach, Dex and his team must devise a last-shot creative solution to get the normals involved without losing the city to chaos and corpses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Blood Bane Tower</i> (Book 3) - When ex-cons kidnap a young human woman, Dex rushes to save the damsel in distress. But after the rescue, Ian can’t help but feel slighted when the woman looks past his superhuman sexual aura and falls for his wizard instead. It’s even worse when his whole department gets trapped in the Netherworld with a trio of hungry dragons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>London Growl</i> (Book 4) - Ian hits a bit of an emotional snag when word comes in that Rachel has been kidnapped. He rushes off across the pond in order to save her. But in order to track her down, he must team up with Rachel's current partner, a man who clearly idolizes James Bond. It’s even worse because Ian's current partner, Harvey the werebear, decides he wants to play the part of Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp;</p>";
