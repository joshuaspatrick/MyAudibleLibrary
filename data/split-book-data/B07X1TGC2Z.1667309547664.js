window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Every life reaches that crucial intersection, the place where you must choose your fate, or have it chosen for you. For best-selling author Rich Cohen (<i>The Fish That Ate the Whale, The Last Pirate of New York</i>), it came in a writing workshop senior year in college, when, at 17, he had to knuckle under to a ruthless professor or make a righteous, self-defeating stand.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story of that decision and the resulting struggle takes us from the winter streets of Chicago to the candy-colored bars of New Orleans to the glory of late 20th century Manhattan, while raising certain fundamental questions: What’s the difference between constructive and destructive criticism? What can a father do to help his child and when has he gone too far? Is it worth telling a bully to f--k off even if it may determine the direction of the rest of your life?&nbsp;</p> <p>You will meet indelible characters along the way, especially Herbie, the author’s father (author of the classic business book <i>You Can Negotiate Anything</i>) who wears two watches, one on each wrist, because, as he says, \"A man with one watch thinks he knows the time, while a man with two watches can never be sure.\"</p> <p>At once funny and serious, this story is perfect for any parent wanting to help their kids find their way in the world, or for any kid who just wants to be free.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
