Only one thing stood between the planet and destruction: the Doctor. For 900 years he defended the planet and the tiny town of Christmas against the forces that would destroy it. </p> <p>Some of what happened during those terrible years is well documented. But most of it has remained shrouded in mystery and darkness. Until now. This is a glimpse of just some of the terrors the people faced, the monstrous threats the Doctor defeated. These are the tales of the monsters who found themselves afraid--and of the one man who was not. </p> <p>David Troughton, who has appeared several times in Doctor Who, reads these four original stories.</p>";
