window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this middle-grade fantasy, perfect for fans of <i>Nevermoor</i> and The School for Good and Evil series, humor, heart, and a symphony of magic take center stage.</p> <p>Amelia Jones has always dreamed of attending the Mystwick School of Musicraft, where the world’s most promising musicians learn to create musical magic. Unfortunately, Amelia botches her audition and her dream comes crashing down—until the school agrees to give her a second chance. Amelia vows to do whatever it takes to make her dream come true.</p> <p>However, between a teacher who really dislikes her and a roommate who wants to see her expelled, Amelia has her hands full. On top of that, supernatural powers are threatening Mystwick, and Amelia might be the only person who can save the school…but only if she can remain true to herself. The combination of Jessica Khoury’s storytelling mastery, the highly-nuanced performance by award-winning narrator Suzy Jackson, and the songs, musical interludes, and original compositions included in this audio (all performed by the NJSO Youth Orchestras) makes it a treat for all fans of the fantasy genre.</p> <p>\"Toe-tapping fantasy mixes music and mystery.\"<br> <i>—Kirkus Review on Jessica Khoury's The Mystwick School of Musicraft</i>&nbsp;</p>";
