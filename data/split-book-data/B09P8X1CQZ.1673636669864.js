window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After his crucifixion and resurrection, Jesus gave his disciples an assignment to change the world - but told them to wait until the power of the Holy Spirit had come upon them before setting out. His charge to modern-day believers is no different: To do the works that Jesus did (and even greater ones, as he said), it is imperative that we operate from the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit.</p> <p>But who is this mysterious Third Person of the Trinity? How do we get this power, and what are we to do with it when we receive it?</p> <p>Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and beloved longtime host of <i>The 700 Club</i>, tackles these questions and many others in this, the final book of a life that is now in its ninth decade. Robertson traces the path of the Holy Spirit through both the Old and New Testaments and shares stories from his own life and that of many <i>700 Club</i> viewers testifying to how the power of the Holy Spirit has miraculously freed and healed them today.</p> <p>If you want a better understanding of the Holy Spirit and are hungry to know more about the power that is available through him to every Christ follower today, this book is for you.</p>";
