window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A masterpiece of suspense from number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lee Child&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Four people in a car, hoping to make Chicago by morning. One man driving, eyes on the road. Another man next to him, telling stories that don’t add up. A woman in the back, silent and worried. And next to her, a huge man with a broken nose, hitching a ride east to Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>An hour behind them, a man lies stabbed to death in an old pumping station. He was seen going in with two others, but he never came out. He has been executed, the knife work professional, the killers vanished. Within minutes, the police are notified. Within hours, the FBI descends, laying claim to the victim without ever saying who he was or why he was there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>All Reacher wanted was a ride to Virginia. All he did was stick out his thumb. But he soon discovers he has hitched more than a ride. He has tied himself to a massive conspiracy that makes him a threat - to both sides at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In Lee Child’s white-hot thriller, nothing is what it seems, and nobody is telling the truth. As the tension rises, the twists come fast and furious, keeping listeners guessing and gasping until the explosive finale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Praise for number-one best-selling author Lee Child and his Reacher series&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Child is a superb craftsman of suspense.” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>“The truth about Reacher gets better and better.” (Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times</i>)</p> <p>“Implausible, irresistible Reacher remains just about the best butt-kicker in thriller-lit.” (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)</p>";
