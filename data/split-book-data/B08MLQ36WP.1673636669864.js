window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Edward McKendree Bounds (1835-1913) was an author, attorney, and Methodist pastor. In <i>The Weapon of Prayer</i>, Bounds explains the necessity and the realities of prayer. Stating that the life of the individual believer “has its being, bloom, and fruitage in prayer”, he shows that throughout the Bible, many of God’s greatest acts were prompted by prayer. Bounds believes that prayer is a priority, more important than other Christian duties such as sacred works, communion, and church activities. In <i>Power Through Prayer</i> Bounds stresses the imperative of vital prayer in the life of a pastor. <i>The Essentials of Prayer</i> is a classic on prayer written for the layman in which Bounds discusses the parts of prayer. This anthology includes sketches of the prayer lives of dedicated Christians like David Brainerd, Jonathan Edwards, and George Muller.</p>";
