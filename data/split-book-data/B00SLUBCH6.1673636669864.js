window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Troughton reads four original stories set in different periods of the Siege of Trenzalore, featuring the Eleventh Doctor as played by Matt Smith. </p> <ul> <li>\"Let it Snow\" by Justin Richards </li> <li>\"An Apple a Day\" by George Mann </li> <li>\"Strangers in the Outland\" by Paul Finch </li> <li>\"The Dreaming\" by Mark Morris. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>As it had been foretold, the armies of the Universe gathered at Trenzalore. Only one thing stood between the planet and destruction: the Doctor. For 900 years he defended the planet and the tiny town of Christmas against the forces that would destroy it. </p> <p>Some of what happened during those terrible years is well documented. But most of it has remained shrouded in mystery and darkness. Until now. This is a glimpse of just some of the terrors the people faced, the monstrous threats the Doctor defeated. These are the tales of the monsters who found themselves afraid--and of the one man who was not. </p> <p>David Troughton, who has appeared several times in Doctor Who, reads these four original stories.</p>";
