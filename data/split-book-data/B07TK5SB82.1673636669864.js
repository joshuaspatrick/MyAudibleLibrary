window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Growing up is hard enough without the added pressure of a hiccup in the fabric of space-time.</p> <p>Wally Roux is a teenage genius with a big imagination and a big heart, who just moved to Savannah, GA, from Maine with his mom, who adopted him when he was an infant. In this charming and sweet solo performance, Wally investigates what is causing a number of strange events and occurrences.
